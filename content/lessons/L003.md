# Lesson 003 — Digital Electronics Refresher

**Level:** Beginner  
**Duration:** 10–15 minutes  

---

## Concept Overview
Digital electronics uses discrete values (0 and 1) to represent information.  
These values correspond to voltage levels in hardware.

---

## Core Concepts
- Logic gates
- Combinational circuits
- Sequential circuits
- Clocked systems

---

## Industry Relevance
Digital logic is the base of RTL, verification, synthesis, and VLSI design.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Digital systems use binary logic
- Logic gates are building blocks
- Sequential logic uses memory and clock

---

## Self-Test
1. What is the difference between combinational and sequential logic?  

---

## Solutions
1. Sequential logic depends on clock and past state
