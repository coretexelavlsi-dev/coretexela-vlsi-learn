## Concept Overview
Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) allows millions to billions of transistors to be integrated on a single silicon chip.  
This enables modern electronic systems to be smaller, faster, and more power-efficient.

In simple terms, VLSI is how ideas become hardware.

## Visual Explanation
Early computers used discrete components.  
Integrated circuits combined many components.  
VLSI packs entire systems onto a single chip.

---

## Industry Relevance
VLSI is used in smartphones, laptops, automobiles, data centers, and AI accelerators.  
Every modern electronic product depends on VLSI-designed chips.
