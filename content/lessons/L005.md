# Lesson 005 — Number System Conversions

**Level:** Beginner  
**Stage:** Digital Electronics  
**Duration:** 10–15 minutes

## Concept Overview
Number system conversion is the process of converting a number from one base to another.

Conversions are required because:
- Humans use decimal
- Hardware uses binary
- Engineers use hexadecimal and octal

Correct conversion is critical in RTL coding and debugging.

---

## Binary to Decimal
Multiply each bit by powers of 2.

Example:  
(1101)₂ = 1×2³ + 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 13₁₀

---

## Decimal to Binary
Repeated division by 2.

Example:  
(25)₁₀ = (11001)₂

---

## Binary to Octal
Group binary bits in sets of 3.

Example:  
(101101)₂ = (55)₈

---

## Binary to Hexadecimal
Group binary bits in sets of 4.

Example:  
(11110000)₂ = (F0)₁₆

---

## Why Hexadecimal?
- Compact representation
- Easy debugging
- Direct binary mapping

---

## Key Takeaways
- Binary is the base for all conversions
- Grouping simplifies octal and hex
- Accuracy is critical in digital design
