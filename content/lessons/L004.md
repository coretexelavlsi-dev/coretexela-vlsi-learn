# Lesson 004 — Number Systems

**Level:** Beginner  
**Stage:** Digital Electronics  
**Duration:** 10–15 minutes

## Concept Overview
A number system defines how numbers are represented using a specific set of digits.  
In digital electronics, number systems are essential because hardware understands only binary (0 and 1).

Different number systems are used for:
- Human readability (decimal)
- Hardware implementation (binary)
- Compact representation (octal, hexadecimal)

Understanding number systems is the first step toward digital and VLSI design.

## Types of Number Systems

### Decimal (Base 10)
Digits: 0–9  
Example: (245)₁₀

### Binary (Base 2)
Digits: 0 and 1  
Example: (101101)₂  
Each digit is called a **bit**.

### Octal (Base 8)
Digits: 0–7  
Compact form of binary  
Example: (725)₈

### Hexadecimal (Base 16)
Digits: 0–9, A–F  
Used in memory addressing and debugging  
Example: (3AF)₁₆

## Radix (Base)
The radix is the number of unique digits in a system.

| System | Radix |
|------|-------|
| Decimal | 10 |
| Binary | 2 |
| Octal | 8 |
| Hexadecimal | 16 |

---

## Positional Representation
Each digit value depends on its position.

Example:  
(1011)₂ = 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 11₁₀

---

## Why Binary?
- Matches transistor ON/OFF states
- High noise immunity
- Simple and reliable hardware

---

## Key Takeaways
- Number systems define data representation
- Binary is the language of hardware
- Radix determines positional weight
- Hex and octal simplify binary handling
