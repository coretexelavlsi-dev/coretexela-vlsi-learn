# Lesson 006 — Data Representation & Ranges

**Level:** Beginner  
**Stage:** Digital Electronics  
**Duration:** 10–15 minutes

## Concept Overview
Data representation defines how numbers are stored in digital systems using a fixed number of bits.

Because hardware has limited bit-width, every number has a valid range.

Understanding ranges prevents overflow and logic errors in VLSI designs.

---

## Unsigned Representation
All bits represent magnitude.

For n-bit unsigned number:
Range = 0 to (2ⁿ − 1)

Example (4-bit):
0000 → 0  
1111 → 15

Used for counters and addresses.

---

## Signed Representation (2’s Complement)
Used to represent positive and negative numbers.

For n-bit signed number:
Range = −2ⁿ⁻¹ to (2ⁿ⁻¹ − 1)

Example (4-bit):
1000 → −8  
0111 → +7

---

## Signed vs Unsigned

| Type | Range | Use |
|----|----|----|
| Unsigned | 0 to 2ⁿ−1 | Counters |
| Signed | −2ⁿ⁻¹ to 2ⁿ⁻¹−1 | Arithmetic |

---

## Overflow & Underflow

### Overflow
Occurs when result exceeds maximum value.

Example (4-bit unsigned):  
1111 + 0001 → overflow

### Underflow
Occurs when result goes below minimum value.

---

## Why Ranges Matter
- Register sizing
- ALU design
- Fixed-point arithmetic
- HDL signal declarations

---

## Key Takeaways
- Data is stored using fixed bit-width
- Signed and unsigned have different ranges
- 2’s complement is industry standard
- Overflow is a real hardware issue

---

## Self-Test
1. Range of 8-bit unsigned number?  
2. Range of 8-bit signed number?  
3. Why does overflow occur?

---

## Solutions
1. 0 to 255  
2. −128 to +127  
3. Result exceeds bit-width
